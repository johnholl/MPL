* multiple choices for a sale, and restructuring for it like items, adding amounts, etc X
* forgotten password logic
*** connection of firebase back to sheets
* correct info on home page (sales totals, and adding in targets etc)
* correctly calculate commissions based on level / setting level for a user (should have functions that calculate total sales)

* images, and completion image

* calculating price and commission correctly





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Oh, and make it Spanish! (can happen before firebase connection back to sheets. so maybe finish up english frontend first)

* packaging and shipping

* restructuring...data management is not great.
    How can we grab data early and rerender subcomponents from firebase hook? <-- low priority (context manager)

* general styling: coloring sales / sales list page / filtering perhaps   <-- low priority
