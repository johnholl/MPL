* coloring sales / sales list page / filtering   <-- low priority
* multiple choices for a sale, and restructuring for it like items, adding amounts, etc
* forgotten password logic
* connection of firebase back to sheets
* form validation
* correct info on home page (sales totals, and adding in targets etc)
* correctly calculate commissions based on level / setting level for a user
* Oh, and make it Spanish!
* packaging and shipping
* restructuring...data management is not great. How can we grab data early and rerender subcomponents from firebase hook?
